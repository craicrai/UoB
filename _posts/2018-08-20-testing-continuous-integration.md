## Getting set up

Make sure you have these two things on your computer:

* A Python distribution.  If you haven't got one already, I recommend 

## Getting started

* Go to https://github.com
* If you haven't got an account, make one now.  Use your `.bham.ac.uk`
  address, it gives you access to some education features (if you ask for
  them).
* Make you're at the home page https://github.com
* Click on the "+" at top right of the screen.  Choose "New repository".
* Set "play-poker" as the repository name.
* Put anything you like (or nothing) into the "Description" field.
* Check the checkbox for "Initialize this repository with a README".
* In the "Add a license" list box, select "BSD 2-Clause 'Simplified' License" 
* Click the big green "Create repository" button.
* You should be on your new repository home page.
* Select the URL of your repository from the URL bar, and copy it.  The URL
  will be of form ``https://github.com/your-user-name/play-poker``.
* Open the Terminal (see below).
