* when: Monday 25th June, 1-2pm.
* where: Murray Learning Centre UG07
* what: Language Gallery

We've been talking about different languages used for academic computing, and one topic that has come up several times is - which language should I use?

In this meeting, we'll be talking about these 4 popular languages, each of
which are more or less essential in their own niche:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/about);
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) - [get example code and data files](https://github.com/Murray2015/UoB/tree/language_gallery_R/R_language_gallery);
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com);
* [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

There will be a 10 minute talk on each, in which someone who uses the language
says something about what the language is good for, why it's good, and when
it's not so good.
